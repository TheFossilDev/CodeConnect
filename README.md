# CodeConnect front-end UI
## What are all of these files???
We are generating our front-end interface with Next.js. This is a competitor to the simpler create-react-app. Create react app (CRA) is good for single page applications, but CodeConnect will be creating multiple pages that a user can navigate between. Every solution in CRA that helps with this is hacky and can present issues. We will be using Next.js to better support the Multi Page Application use-case.
